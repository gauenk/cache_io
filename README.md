This repo has four tasks:
1. Allows users to write/read results from their projects with the exact configuration. 
2. Creates a meshgrid of experiments from a yaml-like file.
3. Links trained models to a testing grid of experiments.
4. Launches a grid of experiments on a SLURM cluster.

This compliments "Weights&Biases" for logging and visualization.

If you want to use this repo, it is best to checkout the "script/example.py" for how I use it.
