This repo allows users to cache the results from their projects to be loaded more quickly. This like a home-made version of "Weights&Biases" before they became a popular, great code base. I recommend [checking them out](https://github.com/wandb). See also [ml_collections](https://github.com/google/ml_collections).

If you want to use this repo, it is best to checkout the "script/example.py" for how I use it.
